                <p class="tp-text">
                    UniBites aimed to address food waste at the university level by exploring whether a campus-focused
                    model similar to Too Good To Go could be viable for students, dining services, and local businesses.
                    The project focused on identifying real gaps through primary and secondary research, then
                    translating those insights into a practical, student-centered solution.

                        Our team followed the design thinking process throughout the semester, beginning with extensive
                        research into food waste on campus. We conducted interviews with local restaurants, campus
                        organizations, and food pantries to understand operational constraints, willingness to
                        participate, and potential barriers. Research findings suggested strong interest in a platform
                        that could redistribute surplus food efficiently while remaining accessible to students.

                        Based on research insights, I independently designed a comprehensive interactive prototype that
                        translated our findings into a cohesive user experience. The prototype included multiple
                        discovery and ordering pathways, such as an interactive map, list-based browsing, and a
                        social-style feed for sharing food availability. The full end-to-end flow—from discovery to
                        checkout and order confirmation—was designed and built solely by me.

                    UniBites demonstrates how research-driven design can translate complex social and logistical
                    challenges into an intuitive digital experience. The project highlights my ability to synthesize

                    grounded in real stakeholder needs.

                    Looking back, UniBites evolved from a broad exploration of campus food waste into a fully realized
                    platform concept grounded in real research. Designing the complete prototype independently
                    challenged me to think critically about scalability, accessibility, and user motivation. The project
                    strengthened my confidence in owning the full UX process, from research synthesis to high-fidelity
                    interaction design while working within a collaborative, research-driven team environment.
