                    business websites in partnership with the Bloomington Council for Community Accessibility and the
                    City of Bloomington. As part of the Serve IT Accessibility Council, our team reviewed websites to
                    identify barriers that could impact users with cognitive, visual, or hearing disabilities. The goal
                    was to provide clear, actionable recommendations that would help make web content more inclusive,
                    usable, and compliant with accessibility best practices.</p>

                <h2 class="tp-heading">Implementation</h2>
                <p class="tp-text">Throughout the Fall 2023 semester, my team and I met weekly to review local business
                    websites, including restaurants, retail stores, and service providers. We conducted accessibility
                    audits using industry-standard tools such as WAVE (Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool) and Axe
                    DevTools to assess issues related to color contrast, keyboard navigation, content structure, image
                    and video alt text, and interactive components such as carousels.
                    <br><br>
                    For each website, we completed a series of structured surveys provided by our client, documenting
                    accessibility issues and recommending specific improvements. These surveys were then submitted to
                    the City of Bloomington for review and follow-up. Midway through the semester, our team identified a
                    gap in our workflow and adjusted our process to ensure that all required surveys were completed for
                    every website evaluated. By adapting quickly, we successfully reviewed and submitted accessibility
                    recommendations for over 15 local businesses.

                <p class="tp-text">This project significantly expanded my understanding of web accessibility and
                    inclusive design. Starting with limited prior knowledge, I gained hands-on experience identifying
                    accessibility issues and evaluating websites through the lens of diverse user needs. The experience
                    reinforced the importance of designing digital experiences that are usable by everyone and
                    strengthened my technical and analytical skills related to accessibility auditing and UX evaluation.
