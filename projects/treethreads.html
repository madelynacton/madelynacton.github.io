                    The goal of TreeThreads was to explore how human-centered design principles can influence user
                    behavior and promote sustainability. As part of an introductory Human Computer Interaction and
                    Design course,
                    my team was tasked with identifying a real-world problem and designing a solution that prioritizes
                    user needs, motivations, and accessibility.
                    <br><br>
                    My group focused on clothing consumerism and sustainability, aiming to reduce textile waste by
                    encouraging secondhand buying and selling while rewarding users for environmentally responsible
                    actions.

                <p class="tp-text">
                    TreeThreads was designed as a mid-fidelity prototype that emphasizes usability, clarity, and
                    behavior-driven design. Early in the process, we applied foundational HCI concepts—such as
                    affordances, feedback, and mental models—to ensure the interface felt intuitive to first-time users.
                    Classic examples like the “doorknob problem” helped guide our design decisions by reminding us that
                    good design should communicate function without explanation.
                    <br><br>
                    We structured the platform similarly to familiar resale apps, allowing users to browse, list, and
                    purchase clothing with minimal friction. To encourage sustainable behavior, we introduced a rewards
                    system where users earn “leaves” for actions such as using eco-friendly packaging or choosing
                    secondhand items. These incentives were intentionally integrated into the user flow to reinforce
                    positive habits without overwhelming the experience.
                    <br><br>
                    The final prototype was created collaboratively, with a strong focus on user-centered decision
                    making, visual hierarchy, and consistency across screens.

                <p class="tp-text">
                    The final TreeThreads prototype successfully demonstrates how thoughtful interface design can
                    encourage sustainable consumer behavior. By combining familiar marketplace patterns with subtle
                    incentive mechanisms, the platform lowers the barrier to secondhand shopping while promoting
                    environmentally conscious choices.
                    <br><br>
                    This project strengthened my understanding of how design decisions directly affect user behavior and
                    reinforced the importance of designing with empathy, clarity, and purpose.
